We aim for this group to be a forum for users to post questions about the tool, methods, and datasets in support of Sustainable Development Goals monitoring. The |trends.earth| team will monitor the group and answer questions as needed, but we'll get the most out of this community if users support each other by answering questions based on their unique background and experiences. The group will also be used for announcements on tool updates and capacity building efforts."

Productivity, soil carbon, and land cover chance (the three sub-indicators of SDG 15.3.1) are combined using a “one out, all out” principle. In other words: if there is a decline in any of the three indicators at a particular pixel, then that pixel is mapped as being “degraded”."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/faq.rst:200
msgid "The final output should be interpreted as showing areas potentially degraded. The indicator of land degradation is based on changes in productivity, land cover and soil organic carbon. Several factor could lead to the identification of patterns of degradation which do not seem to correlate to what is happening on the ground, the date of analysis being a very important one. If the climatic conditions at the beginning of the analysis were particularly wet, for example, trends from that moment on could show significant decreases in primary productivity, and degradation. The user can use Trends.Earth to address some of this issues correcting by the effect of climate. The resolution of the data could potentially be another limitation. Trends.Earth by default uses global datasets which will not be the most relevant at all scales and geographies. A functionality to use local data will be added shortly."

msgid "**All of the sub-indicators are measuring vegetation using three different methods: how does this contribute to understanding and identifying land degradation?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/faq.rst:217
msgid "Vegetation is a key component of most ecosystems, and serve as a good proxy for their overall functioning and health. The three subindicators used for SDG 15.3.1 measure different aspects of land cover, which do relate to vegetation. Primary productivity directly measures the change in amount of biomass present in one area, but it does not inform us if that change is positive or not (not all increases in plant biomass should be interpreted as improvement). Land cover fills that gap by interpreting the landscape from a thematic perspective looking at what was there before and what is there now. It does include vegetation, but also bare land, urban and water. Finally, the soil organic carbon indicator uses the land cover map to inform the changes in soil organic carbon over time. This method is not ideal, but given the current state of global soil science and surveying, there is consensus that it this point in time and globally, this is the best approach."

msgid "The final toolbox will be available as both as an offline and online version. The online version allows users to access current datasets more easily, while also allowing users to leverage Google Earth Engine to provide computing in the cloud. An offline version allows users to access data and perform analyses where internet connectivity may be limited, but it does have the disadvantage of requiring users to have enough local computing capacity to run analyses locally. The technical team intends to build the offline version of the toolbox and provide countries with data relevant for reporting at the national level within the pilot project countries."
